# How To Make and Promote Apps Sucessfully
## Background and motivation
According to Statista, the global mobile internet penetration has exceeded half the world’s population, while the average daily time spent accessing online content from a mobile device, such as a smartphone, a tablet computer or wearable, has reached 185 minutes daily among Millennials. Currently, the two largest global platforms for app distribution are Apple’s App Store, which caters to iOS users, and Google Play, the official app store for the Android OS. The fact that mobile apps are relatively easier to create than computer apps, as well as their considerably lower price has translated into a growing industry which produce every year more and more. It is impossible to know exactly how many apps are there, but as of March 2018 there were some 3.6 million apps in Google Play alone. So, how to create a successful mobile app winning more customers in fierce competition? What key ingredients do the popular apps possess? In order to figure out these questions, we make some descriptive statistical analysis in this report.
